  The first call in the sequence searches the wide string pointed to by \a s1

  pointed to by \a s2. If no such wide character is found, then there are no tokens

  \desc \b \this converts a sequence of multi-byte characters that begins
  in the conversion state described by the object pointed to by \a ps,
  from the array indirectly pointed to by \a src into a sequence of
  corresponding wide characters
  
  If \a dst is not a null pointer, the converted characters are stored
  into the array pointed to by \a dst.  Conversion continues up to and
  including a terminating null character, which is also stored.

  Conversion stops earlier in two cases: when a sequence of bytes is
  encountered that does not form a valid multi-byte character, or
  (if \a dst is not a null pointer) when \a len wide characters have been
  stored into the array pointed to by \a dst.  Each conversion takes place
  as if by a call to the \b mbrtowc function.

  If \a dst is not a null pointer, the pointer object pointed to by
  \a src is assigned either a null pointer (if conversion stopped due to
  reaching a terminating null character) or the address just past the
  last multi-byte character converted (if any). If conversion stopped
  due to reaching a terminating null character and if \a dst is not a null
