</pre><h5>Description</h5><p><b>wcstok</b> A sequence of calls to <b>wcstok</b> breaks the wide string pointed to by <b>s1</b> 
  into a sequence of tokens, each of which is delimited by a wide character from the 
  wide string pointed to by <b>s2</b>. The first call in the sequence has a non-null 
  first argument; subsequent calls in the sequence have a null first argument. 
  The separator wide string pointed to by <b>s2</b> may be different from call to call. </p><p>The first call in the sequence searches the wide string pointed to by <b>s1</b>
  for the first wide character that is not contained in the current separator wide string
  pointed to by <b>s2</b>. If no such wide character is found, then there are no tokens 
  in the wide string pointed to by <b>s1</b> and <b>wcstok</b> returns a null pointer. 
  If such a wide character is found, it is the start of the first token.</p><p><b>wcstok</b> then searches from there for a wide character that is contained in 
  the current wide separator string. If no such wide character is found, the current token 
  extends to the end of the wide string pointed to by <b>s1</b>, and subsequent searches 
  for a token will return a null pointer. If such a wude character is found, it is 
  overwritten by a wide null character, which terminates the current token. <b>wcstok</b>
  saves a pointer to the following wide character, from which the next search for a 
  token will start.</p><p>Each subsequent call, with a null pointer as the value of the first argument, 
  starts searching from the saved pointer and behaves as described above.</p><h5>Note</h5><p><b>wcstok</b> maintains static state and is therefore not reentrant and
  not thread safe.  See <a href="wcstok_r.htm">wcstok_r</a> for a thread-safe and reentrant
  variant.
