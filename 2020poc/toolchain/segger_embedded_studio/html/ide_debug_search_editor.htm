<p>When a program is built with debugging enabled, the debugging information contains
the paths and filenames of all the source files for the program
in order to allow the debugger to find them.  If a program or library linked
into the program is on a different machine than the one on which it was
compiled, or if the source files were moved after the program was compiled,
the debugger will not be able to find the source files.</p><p>In this situation, the simplest way to help SEGGER Embedded Studio find the source
files is to add the directory containing the source files to one of its source-file
search paths. Alternatively, if SEGGER Embedded Studio cannot find a source file,
it will prompt you for its location and will record its new location in the source-file
map.</p><h3>Debug source-file search paths</h3><p>Debug's source-file search paths can be used to help the debugger locate
source files that are no longer located where they were at compile
time. When a source file cannot be found, the search-path directories will
be checked, in turn, to see if they contain the source file. SEGGER Embedded Studio maintains
two debug source-file search paths:</p><ul><li><i>Project-session search path</i>:&nbsp;&nbsp;This path is for
  the current project session and does not apply to all projects.
</li>
<li><i>The global search path</i>:&nbsp;&nbsp;This system-wide path 
  applies to all projects.</li></ul><p>The project-session search path is checked before the global search path.</p><h5>To edit the debug search paths:</h5><ul><li>Choose <b>Debug > Options > Search Paths</b>.</li></ul><h3>Debug source file map</h3><p>If a source file cannot be found while debugging and the debugger has to
prompt the user for its location, the results are stored in the debug source
file map. The debug source file map simply correlates, or <i>maps</i>, the original
pathnames to the new locations. When a file cannot be found at its original
location or in the debug search paths, the debug source file map is checked
to see if a new location has been recorded for the file or if the user has
specified that the file does not exist. Each project session maintains its
own source file map, the map is not shared by all projects.</p><h5>To view the debug source file map:</h5><ul><li>Choose <b>Debug > Options > Search Paths</b>.</li></ul><h5>To remove individual entries from the debug source file map:</h5><ul><li>Choose <b>Debug > Options > Search Paths</b>.
  </li>
<li>Right-click the mapping to delete.
  </li>
<li>Choose <b>Delete Mapping</b> from the shortcut menu.</li></ul><h5>To remove all entries from the debug source file map:</h5><ul><li>Choose <b>Debug > Options > Search Paths</b>.
  </li>
<li>Right-click any mapping.
  </li>
<li>Choose <b>Delete All Mappings</b> from the shortcut menu.</li></ul>
