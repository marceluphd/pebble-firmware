<p>SEGGER Embedded Studio has a flexible docking system you can use to position windows
as you like them. You can dock windows in the SEGGER Embedded Studio 
window or in the four <i>head-up display</i> windows. SEGGER Embedded Studio will
remember the position of the windows when you leave the IDE and will restore
them when you return.</p><h3>Window groups</h3><p>You can organize SEGGER Embedded Studio windows into <i>window groups</i>. A window
group has multiple windows docked in it, only one of which is
<i>active</i> at a time. The window group displays the active window's title
for each of the windows docked in the group.</p><p>Clicking on the window icons in the window group's header changes the
active window. Hovering over a docked window's icon in the header will
display that window's title in a <i>tooltip</i>.</p><h5>To dock a window to a different window group:</h5><ul><li>Press and hold the left mouse button over the title of the window you wish to move.
  </li>
<li>As you start dragging, all window groups, including hidden window groups,
    become visible.
  </li>
<li>Drag the window over the window group to dock in.
  </li>
<li>Release the mouse button.</li></ul><p>Holding <b>Ctrl</b> when moving the window will prevent the window from being docked.
If you do not dock a window on a window group, the window will float in a new
window group.</p><h3>Perspectives</h3><p>SEGGER Embedded Studio remembers the dock position and visibility of each window in each
<i>perspective</i>.  The most common use for this is to lay your windows out
in the <b>Standard</b> perspective, which is the perspective used when you are
editing and not debugging.  When SEGGER Embedded Studio starts to debug a program, it
switches to the <b>Debug</b> perspective.  You can now lay out your windows in
this perspective and SEGGER Embedded Studio will remember how you laid them them out.
When you stop debugging, SEGGER Embedded Studio will revert to the <b>Standard</b> perspective
and that window layout for editing; when you return to <b>Debug</b> perspective
on the next debug session, the windows will be restored to how you laid them
out in that for debugging.</p><p>SEGGER Embedded Studio remembers the layout of windows, in all perspectives, such that
they can be restored when you run SEGGER Embedded Studio again.  However, you may
wish to revert back to the standard docking positions; to do this:</p>
