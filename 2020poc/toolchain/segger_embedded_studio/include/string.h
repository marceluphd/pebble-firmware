/*! \overview
  The header file \<string.h\> defines functions that operate on 
  arrays that are interpreted as null-terminated strings.

  Various methods are used for determining the lengths of the arrays, but in 
  all cases a \b{char *} or \b{void *} argument points to the initial (lowest 
  addressed) character of the array. If an array is accessed beyond the end of 
  an object, the behavior is undefined.

  Where an argument declared as \b size_t \em n specifies the length of an array 
  for a function, \em n can have the value zero on a call to that function. 
  Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the description of a particular function, 
  pointer arguments must have valid values on a call with a zero size. On such 
  a call, a function that locates a character finds no occurrence, a function 
  that compares two character sequences returns zero, and a function that copies 
  characters copies zero characters.

  \desc \b \this maps the number in \a num to a message string. Typically, 
  the values for \a num come from \b errno, but \b \this can 
  map any value of type \b int to a message.

  \b \this returns a pointer to the message string.
  The program must not modify the returned message string.
  The message may be overwritten by a subsequent call to \b \this.
