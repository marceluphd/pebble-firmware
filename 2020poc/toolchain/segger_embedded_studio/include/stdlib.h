  If the subject sequence begins with a minus sign, the value resulting from

  of letters and digits representing an integer with the radix specified by \b base.
  The letters from a (or A) through z (or Z) represent the values 10 through 35;
  only letters and digits whose ascribed values are less than that of \b base
  are permitted.

  If the value of \b base is 16, the characters \q{0x} or \q{0X} may optionally
  precede the sequence of letters and digits, following the optional sign.

  The subject sequence is defined as the longest initial subsequence of the input
  string, starting with the first non-white-space character, that is of the expected
  form. The subject sequence contains no characters if the input string is empty
  or consists entirely of white space, or if the first non-white-space character
  is other than a sign or a permissible letter or digit.

  If the subject sequence has the expected form and the value of \b base
  is zero, the sequence of characters starting with the first digit is interpreted
  as an integer constant. If the subject sequence has the expected form and the
  value of \b base is between 2 and 36, it is used as the base for conversion.

  If the subject sequence begins with a minus sign, the value resulting from
  the conversion is negated.

  A pointer to the final string is stored in the object pointed to by \b endptr,
  provided that \b endptr is not a null pointer.

  If the subject sequence is empty or does not have the expected form, no conversion
  is performed, the value of \b nptr is stored in the object pointed to by
  \b endptr, provided that \b endptr is not a null pointer.

  \b \this returns the converted value, if any. If no conversion could
  be performed, zero is returned. If the correct value is outside the range of
  representable values, \ref LLONG_MAX or \ref ULLONG_MAX is returned according
  to the sign of the value, if any, and the value of the macro \b ERANGE is
  stored in \ref errno.
