Follow these instructions to install the nRF Connect SDK:

1.  Create a folder in which you want to install the nRF Connect SDK.
    In the following instructions, we will refer to this folder as <NCS>.

2.  Unzip the ncs-toolchain zip into the folder you created by right-clicking
    the .zip file and selecting 'Extract All'.
    This will create the following folder: <NCS>/<ncs-toolchain>

3.  Navigate to the <NCS>/<ncs-toolchain> folder.

4.  Double-click `git-bash.exe` to open a command line window from which you
    can install the nRF Connect SDK.

5.  To clone and update the nRF Connect SDK GitHub repositories, type the following
    command and press enter:

    ncsmgr init-ncs

6.  Double-click `SEGGER Embedded Studio.cmd` to open SEGGER Embedded Studio.

7.  In SEGGER Embedded Studio, go to 'Tools' > 'Options' and select the 'nRF Connect' tab.
    Set the locations of the GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain and Zephyr.
    Use the 'Browse' button to select the following folders:

    GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain Directory: <NCS>/<ncs-toolchain>/opt
    Zephyr Base:                          <NCS>/zephyr

8.  Click 'File' > 'Open nRF Connect SDK Project' to open a sample application.
    For example, to open the Asset Tracker application, select the following values:

    CMakeLists.txt:  <NCS>/nrf/applications/asset_tracker/CMakeLists.txt
    Board directory: <NCS>/zephyr/boards/arm/nrf9160_pca10090
    Board name:      nrf9160_pca10090ns
    Build directory: <NCS>/nrf/applications/asset_tracker/build_nrf9160_pca10090ns

9.  Click 'Build' > 'Build' to build the application.
    If the application builds without errors, your installation was successful.


You can now start developing your own application!
