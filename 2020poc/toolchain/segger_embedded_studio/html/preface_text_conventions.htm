<h5>Menus and user interface elements</h5><p>When this document refers to any user interface element, it will do so in <b>bold font</b>.
For instance, you will often see reference to the <b>Project Explorer</b>, which is taken to
mean the project explorer window.  Similarly, you'll see references to the <b>Standard</b>
toolbar which is positioned at the top of the SEGGER Embedded Studio window, just below the menu bar
on Windows and Linux.</p><p>When you are directed to select an item from a menu in SEGGER Embedded Studio, we use the
form <i>menu-name</i> <b>></b> <i>item-name</i>. For instance, <b>File > Save</b>
means that you need to click the <b>File</b> menu in the menu bar and then select
the <b>Save</b> item.  This form extends to items in sub-menus, so <b>File > Open With Binary Editor</b>
has the obvious meaning.</p><h5>Keyboard accelerators</h5><p>Frequently-used commands are assigned keyboard <i>accelerators</i> to speed up common tasks.
SEGGER Embedded Studio uses standard Windows and Mac OS keyboard accelerators wherever possible.</p><p>Windows and Linux have three key modifiers which are <b>Ctrl</b>, <b>Alt</b>, and <b>Shift</b>.
For instance, <b>Ctrl+Alt+P</b> means that you should hold down the <b>Ctrl</b> and <b>Alt</b>
buttons whilst pressing the <b>P</b> key; and <b>Shift+F5</b> means that you should hold down
the <b>Shift</b> key whilst pressing <b>F5</b>.</p><p>Mac OS has four key modifiers which are &#8984; (command), &#8997; (option),
&#8963; (control), and &#8679; (shift).  Generally there is a one-to-one correspondence
between the Windows modifiers and the Mac OS modifiers: <b>Ctrl</b> is &#8984;, <b>Alt</b>
is &#8997;, and <b>Shift</b> is &#8679;.  SEGGER Embedded Studio on Mac OS has its own set of unique
key sequences using &#8963; (control) that have no direct Windows equivalent.</p><p>SEGGER Embedded Studio on Windows and Linux also uses <i>key chords</i> to expand the set of
accelerators.  Key chords are key sequences composed of two or more key presses.  For instance,
the key chord <b>Ctrl+T, D</b> means that you should type <b>Ctrl+T</b> followed by
<b>D</b>; and <b>Ctrl+K, Ctrl+Z</b> means that you should type <b>Ctrl+T</b> followed by
<b>Ctrl+Z</b>.  Mac OS does not support accelerator key chords.</p><h5>Code examples and human interaction</h5><p>Throughout the documentation, text printed <b>in this typeface</b> represents
verbatim communication with the computer: for example, pieces of C text, commands
to the operating system, or responses from the computer. In examples, text
printed <i>in this typeface</i> is not to be used verbatim: it represents
a class of items, one of which should be used. For example, this is the format
of one kind of compilation command:</p><p><b>hcl</b> <i>source-file</i></p><p>This means that the command consists of:</p><ul><li>The word <b>hcl</b>, typed exactly like that.
</li>
<li>A <i>source-file</i>: not the text <b>source-file</b>, but
  an item of the <i>source-file</i> class, for example <b>myprog.c</b>.</li></ul><p>Whenever commands to and responses from the computer are mixed in the same
example, the commands (i.e. the items which you enter) will be presented
<tt>in this typeface</tt>. For example, here is a dialog with the computer using
the format of the compilation command given above:</p>
<pre class="rwt-code">c:\code\examples><b>hcl -v myprog.c</b></pre><p>The user types the text <b>hcl -v myprog.c</b> and then presses the enter key
(which is assumed and is not shown); the computer responds with the rest.</p>
